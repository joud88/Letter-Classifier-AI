# Letter-Classifier-AI
A simple image classification project that uses a Teachable Machine-trained model to recognize handwritten or printed letters from images.  Built using Keras and TensorFlow in Google Colab, this project loads a pre-trained .h5 model and predicts the class of an uploaded image (A, B, C).
